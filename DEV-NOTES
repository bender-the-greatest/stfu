When the VirtualBox SDK is updated, you will need to run the following commands when building stfu.sln on Windows:

     tblimp.exe ["path to VirtualBox.tlb"] /out:VirtualBox.Interop.dll
     ildasm.exe VirtualBox.Interop.dll /out:VirtualBox.Interop.il
     del VirtualBox.Interop.dll

Now edit VirtualBox.Interop.il and replace all instances of "marshal ( safearray unsigned int8 )" with "marshal ( safearray int8 )". You may need to play with the spacing to find all of the instances.

And then finally, regenerate the DLL from the modified IL

    ilasm.exe /DLL VirtualBox.Interop.dll

If everything went well we should have a .NET usable COM interface to the VirtualBox COM API :)
