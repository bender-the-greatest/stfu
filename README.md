Show The Friggin' Updates - Display various updates and messages from a Virtualbox guest to the host operating system.

This is currently a work in progress, but at the moment these are our goals for this software:

* Display program notifications from a Virtualbox Windows' guest to a Windows or Linux host
* Display Notification Pane updates from a Virtualbox Windows' guest to a Windows or Linux host
 
Goals down the road:
* Display taskbar notifications from a Virtualbox Linux guest to a Windows or Linux host
* Display program notifications from a Virtualbox from a Linux guest to a Windows or Linux host

There are no current plans to expand this project to work with other VM solutions.
